# NextAuth Session Undefined in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using NextAuth.js with `getServerSideProps` where the session object remains undefined even though the same code works correctly within the `getServerSession` function. This can be frustrating for developers as it creates inconsistencies in accessing user authentication data.  The solution explains how to properly use `getServerSession` and handle potential asynchronous operations.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Configure a NextAuth provider (e.g., Google, Credentials).
4. Run the Next.js development server.

## Problem

The initial implementation attempts to fetch the session within `getServerSideProps`.  This frequently results in an undefined session. This is due to the timing differences in when the session data is ready.

## Solution

The correct approach involves using `unstable_getServerSession` directly within the page component or utilizing a custom middleware function.

## Additional Notes

This issue can be subtle and may manifest differently depending on server-side caching configurations and NextAuth provider settings.
